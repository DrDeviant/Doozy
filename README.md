# Doozy

Hey all, this site has been created for personal use. You are welcome to use it, and it may benefit newbies to cyber security. 
If you are already at an advanced level, then unfortunately this will be of no use to you.

The site contains syntax for popular tools, information regarding ethical hacking and other useful stuff. 

The site is a work in progress and will be kept up-to-date on a regular basis as I learn more and add to my knowledge base, so at times you may get a 404 page or even a link 
with limited information.

The Cheatsheet section contains various different cheatsheets, think of it as a quick reference tool, you may not remember the syntax for curl, so a quick visit to the cheatsheet page and the curl section and voila you are good to go (note as mentioned above, it is just basic commands for now and will get more advanced as my knowledge advances)

The Ethical Hacking section has information on the hacking stages, detailed information on which ports to enumerate and what to do, all quite helpful in CTF scenarios.

A big thank you to all those who have provided me with the knowledge and motivation. (a special thank you to: Adam, Dan, James and Ben ( I have omitted last names for confidential reasons, but you all know who you are) and extending a big thanks to TryHackMe, HackTheBox and TCM (cyber mentor).




Note:
The actual pages with the information are just basic HTML pages, white background and just large text for easier reading.
The homepage is colourful ( same applies to the selection boxes) but  all credits go to the author: html5up.net
